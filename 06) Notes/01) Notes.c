//Some Notes
/*
1. puts() can store only string inside paranthesis. wo string ya double cote ke andar ho ya array bounded variable with char date type ka ho.

2. puts() always print a new line character on console. so cursor goes on next line. Due to this the integer value return by puts always plus one.

3. Keep in mind that do while loop always come after declaration of variable in c language. If we use do before declaration of variable then the error will shown that the variable or identifier is not defined because loop kaise kam karega agar variable declared hi na ho. Aise bhi do variable declaration ke upar hai aur while last mein hai aur condition mein hain to feer kaise work hoga. jaisa ki while ya for loop mein hota hai ki sara kam variable declration ke baad hota hai. feer similarly do while mein bhi hoga. Aise bhi c language mein sara kam variable declaration ke baad hi hota hain. Got it.

4. puts always make cursor to next line everytime. if we have to use loop and result should be more and need to be printed in new line everytime then there is no need to use \n evey time. It will auto send the curson to new line every time and result get printed in new line every time automatically. Got it..

5. The variable in which we store squre root any number must be declared in float because sqrt function can be only store result in float variable. You can accept number from user in integer or float as per your need. but sqrt funtion can use with any data type from float or integer but stores the result in only a float type variable.Got it.

6. small character - 32 = Capital of that Character (on the basic of ASCII value because ASCII value of small letter is 32 more than that of capital letter)
